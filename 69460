    <h2>ðŸ“– My Story</h2>
    <div class="card">
      <h3>From Nothing to Vision</h3>
      <p>I started from absolute zero â€” no money, no comfort, no backup. But I had one thing: a vision that burned in my soul. I sacrificed temporary pleasures to invest in the life I dreamed of. I pushed forward when I had nothing but faith. Now with only $200, I am working in photography, style, and creativity â€” chasing my dream with everything Iâ€™ve got.</p>
      <p>My journey has not been easy. I had to walk away from things that felt good in the moment to chase what truly matters. I live by principles: silence with purpose, humility in all things, relentless discipline, and faith in God. I do not just work â€” I give 200%. Every single day.</p>
      <p>Hereâ€™s what life taught me:</p>
      <ul style="color: #ffeb3b; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
        <li>Greatness requires sacrifice. If youâ€™re not giving up something â€” youâ€™re not going forward.</li>
        <li>People will doubt you. Let your actions be the proof that you were always meant to win.</li>
        <li>Silence can be strength â€” move in silence, let success be your echo.</li>
        <li>Faith and discipline will take you where motivation cannot.</li>
        <li>Start with what you have, even if itâ€™s just a dream and empty pockets. Thatâ€™s enough.</li>
        <li>Every day you delay is a chance you let fear win. Keep moving.</li>
        <li>Respect God, honor your calling, and commit to becoming the best version of yourself.</li>
        <li>Your pain has a purpose â€” let it shape your power.</li>
      </ul>

    <h2>âš½ Sport Journey</h2>
    <div class="card">
      <h3>Discipline Every Day</h3>
      <p>I train daily not to impress, but to stay grounded â€” physically and mentally. Discipline fuels my mind and body. I find inspiration in legends like Cristiano Ronaldo, Messi, Neymar, MbappÃ©, and Michael Jordan. Sports taught me structure, self-belief, and consistency.</p>

    <h2>ðŸŽ¨ Creative Expression</h2>
    <div class="card">
      <h3>Building Identity Through Style</h3>
      <p>Style is not about clothes, itâ€™s about message. Through fashion and photography, I express who I am and what I stand for. I want to build a unique identity, to be remembered not just for beauty, but for meaning behind it.</p>

    <h2>ðŸ“ˆ Personal Growth</h2>
    <div class="card">
      <h3>Mental and Spiritual Elevation</h3>
      <p>I grow by seeking truth. I improve by humbling myself, listening more than I speak, learning daily, and surrendering all I do to God. I seek excellence not for validation, but because it honors the life I was given.</p>
